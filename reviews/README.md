Review:	The paper presents a preliminary result: movement variability 
for subjects with different skills level is visually assessed. 
The work is consistent and well presented, there are some points to be corrected:

- The PDF file (at least in the form i was able to download) has format issues, 
please check the font, spaces after commas and dots, spaces between numbers and 
words in the text.

- remember to update authors' names and emails in the text, and "University of X", 
this is not double blind review

- multiple citation of the same paper within the same period may be avoided 
(i.e. [1] and [2]).

- the formula in II.A is recursive, use a different name than x(t) for the 
embedding function

- Fig.1. While Takens' theorem may be familiar in the context of nonlinear 
dynamics system it is not obviously known to the audience of this conference 
and, most importantly, it is never referred in the text.
Please add a sentence explaining qualitatively that you expect the finite 
embedded matrix to describe s(t) dynamics and how you chose the delay time, 
you may refer the theorem there.

- II.C. I realized that the sentence "The non-dancers were engineering students 
(4 female, 7 male)" summarized the drama of my youth, please consider a trigger 
warning to safeguard engineers.

- The visual assessment of variability is really a good way to show the 
differences between skills, you may write the variances along the PCs in 
order to confirm that the impression we get is consistent with the formal result.


Review 1
--------
Review:	The article describes an experiment presented to collect data through 
inertial sensors. I do not think this research is in the scope of WeRob2016. 
I do not consider it is a novel contribution, the techniques used to collect 
and show data are known.
No analysis or quantification of the results is performed beyond wisually 
present the differences among participants.
On the other hand, there are many errors in the text that in any case, 
must be corrected:
- "Liao, Guo, Qin and Wang" appears instead of the reference.
- In many places words appear together: "thatparticipants" "ofskillfulness" ...

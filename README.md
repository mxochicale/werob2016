Analysis of the Movement Variability in Dance Activities using Wearable Sensors

Author keywords: Accelerometer Wearable Sensors Skill Assessment Pattern Recognition  


#### Abstract:
Variability is an inherent feature of human movement, but little research has been 
done in order to measure such a characteristic using inertial sensors attached to 
personâ€™s body (wearable sensors). Therefore the aim of this preliminary study is 
to investigate the assessment of human movement variability for dance activities. 
We asked thirteen participants to repeatedly dance two salsa steps 
(simple and complex) for 20 seconds. We then used a technique from nonlinear 
dynamics (time-delay embedding) to obtain the reconstructed state space for 
visual assessment of the variability of dancers. Such reconstructed state space 
is graphically linked with their level of skillfulness of the participants.

@article{Bulling2014,
abstract = {The last 20 years have seen ever-increasing research activity in the field of human activity recognition. With activity recognition having considerably matured, so has the number of challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance.},

@article{Frank2010,
abstract = {Activity recognition based on data from mobile wearable devices is becoming an important application area for machine learning. We propose a novel approach based on a combination of feature extraction using time-delay embedding and supervised learning. The computational requirements are considerably lower than existing approaches, so the processing can be done in real time on a low-powered portable device such as a mobile phone. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a large, noisy data set comprising over 50 hours of data from six different subjects, including activities such as running and walking up or down stairs. We also demonstrate the ability of the system to accurately classify an individual from a set of 25 people, based only on the characteristics of their walking gait. The system requires very little parameter tuning, and can be trained with small amounts of data.},

@article{Frank2012,
abstract = {We present a novel framework for analysing univariate time series data. At the heart of the approach is a versatile algorithm for measuring the similarity of two segments of time series called geometric template matching (GeTeM). First, we use GeTeM to compute a similarity measure for clustering and nearest-neighbour classification. Next, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses the similarity measure with hierarchical clustering in order to improve classification performance when unlabelled training data is available. Finally, we present a boosting framework called TDEBOOST, which uses an ensemble of GeTeM classifiers. TDEBOOST augments the traditional boosting approach with an additional step, in which the features used as inputs to the classifier are adapted at each step to improve the training error. We empirically evaluate the proposed approaches on several datasets, such as accelerometer data collected from wearable sensors and ECG data.},

Singular values can be interpreted as the approximate edge length of the bounding box wrapping the attractor in the latent space.

Distinctive gestures, captured by the camera, are matched with the recorded acceleration sig- nal(s) using cross-correlation based time-delay estimation. PCA-based data pre-processing makes the procedure ro- bust against orientation mismatches between the marking gesture and the camera plane.

@article{Banos2014,
abstract = {Signal segmentation is a crucial stage in the activity recognition process; however, this has been rarely and vaguely characterized so far. Windowing approaches are normally used for segmentation, but no clear consensus exists on which window size should be preferably employed. In fact, most designs normally rely on figures used in previous works, but with no strict studies that support them. Intuitively, decreasing the window size allows for a faster activity detection, as well as reduced resources and energy needs. On the contrary, large data windows are normally considered for the recognition of complex activities. In this work, we present an extensive study to fairly characterize the windowing procedure, to determine its impact within the activity recognition process and to help clarify some of the habitual assumptions made during the recognition system design. To that end, some of the most widely used activity recognition procedures are evaluated for a wide range of window sizes and activities. From the evaluation, the interval 1-2 s proves to provide the best trade-off between recognition speed and accuracy. The study, specifically intended for on-body activity recognition systems, further provides designers with a set of guidelines devised to facilitate the system definition and configuration according to the particular application requirements and target activities.},

FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES FOR INERTIAL SENSORS





@article{Figo2010,
abstract = {The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities.},

@article{Gupta2014,
abstract = {Activity recognition is required in various applications such as medical monitoring and rehabilitation. Previously developed activity recognition systems utilizing triaxial accelerometers have provided mixed results, with subject-to-subject variability. This paper presents an accurate activity recognition system utilizing a body worn wireless accelerometer, to be used in the real-life application of patient monitoring. The algorithm utilizes data from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer to classify gait events into six daily living activities and transitional events. The accelerometer can be worn at any location around the circumference of the waist, thereby reducing user training. Feature selection is performed using Relief-F and sequential forward floating search (SFFS) from a range of previously published features, as well as new features introduced in this paper. Relevant and robust features that are insensitive to the positioning of accelerometer around the waist are selected. SFFS selected almost half the number of features in comparison to Relief-F and provided higher accuracy than Relief-F. Activity classification is performed using Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and the results are compared. Activity recognition results on seven subjects with leave-one-person-out error estimates show an overall accuracy of about 98{\%} for both the classifiers. Accuracy for each of the individual activity is also more than 95{\%}.},

The objective is to identify the most important features to recognize human activities. We first design a set of new features (called physical features) based on the physical parameters of human motion to augment the commonly used statistical features. To systematically analyze the impact of the physical features on the performance of the recognition system, a single-layer feature selection framework is developed. Experimental results indicate that physical features are always among the top features selected by different feature selection methods and the recognition accuracy is generally improved to 90{\%}, or 8{\%} better than when only statistical features are used. Moreover, we show that the performance is further improved by 3.8{\%} by extending the single-layer framework to a multi-layer framework which takes advantage of the inherent structure of human activities and performs feature selection and classification in a hierarchical manner.},
